# Catch

Catching and displaying http requests. Mostly useful when you do requests to some external services and what to see what would be received on the other end.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser to see requests and point your services to the same url.
